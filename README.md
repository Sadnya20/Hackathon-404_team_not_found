## 🔍 Ever wondered how airlines decide ticket prices, manage costs, and maximize profits?
This project unlocks the secrets behind airline profitability using cutting-edge machine learning and data-driven insights! 🚀

## 🎯 Project Overview
The **Airline Profit Prediction** system predicts airline profits based on real-world financial and operational metrics. It helps airlines make informed decisions, optimize resources, and boost revenue! 🔥

## 📊 Key Highlights

- **🧠 Smart Predictions:** Uses historical airline data to predict future profits.
- **🛠️ Data Processing & Cleaning:** Transforms messy data into meaningful insights.
- **💡 Feature Engineering:** Creates powerful new metrics that improve accuracy.
- **📊 Power BI Dashboards:** Interactive visualizations for deep analysis.
- **🔄 Automated Updates:** Keeps predictions fresh and accurate.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
We plan to integrate the following:
- **📡 API Deployment on Azure:** Enable real-time profit prediction and easy access.
- **📊 Advanced Power BI Integration:** Enhanced visualization with real-time analytics.
- **🔄 Continuous Model Improvement:** Uploading new datasets to improve model accuracy.

## 🔬 Why Random Forest Regression Over Linear Regression?
We chose **Random Forest Regression** because:
- It captures **non-linear relationships** in airline data.
- It **reduces overfitting** by averaging multiple decision trees.
- It handles **missing and categorical values** better.

Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship, which may not hold in complex airline data.

## ⚖️ Why Standard Scaler Over MinMax Scaler?
We used **Standard Scaler** because:
- It ensures a **zero mean and unit variance**, making it suitable for ML models sensitive to feature scales.
- **MinMax Scaler** can distort data when outliers are present, making it less effective.
